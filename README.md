# Python-Chat-Application
A Simple Python Client-Server model that simulates a chat group, where you can either send a message to all other online users in the group, or only one singular user in a form of a private message.

the project is one of my learning projects to better understand topics such as Networks, Security, ways of storing information and python in general.

Note: All Sent Messages Were stored in a folder in the same repository as the project named "ServerMessages". You must create a new folder yourself otherwise the project most likely WILL NOT WORK.

# Python-Chat-Application
A Simple Python Client-Server model that simulates a chat group, where you can either send a message to all other online users in the group, or only one singular person.
the project is one of my learning projects to better understand topics such as Networks, Security, and python in general.
Note: All Sent Messages Were stored in a folder in the same repository as the project named "ServerMessages". You must create a new folder yourself otherwise it WILL NOT WORK.
